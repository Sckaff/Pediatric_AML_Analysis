# Analyzing transcriptomics of pediatric Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) individuals

A semester-long project on my Bioinformatics class at the University of Florida. Done along with Maria Hurtado. 
We first tried answering - **Can we identify different types of pediatric AML based on unlabeled RNA-seq data?**

I did a more in-depth analysis of the project on Kaggle. [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/fernandosckaff/cancer-research-acute-myeloid-leukemia/) is the link for my first Kaggle Notebook!

Dataset: <a href="https://target-data.nci.nih.gov/Public/AML/mRNA-seq/L3/expression/BCCA/" target="_blank">Link</a>
Cleaned Data: <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jAht30tLDV-gHjQzq18bnwDLYmCiInNU?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Google Drive</a>

I might upload the cleaned data as a Kaggle dataset, and would also love to show how I did the Data Engineering if you're interested!
